[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m63Ajtj7EhM)

Lifeline is a university game project from my Bachelor degree that I've worked on together with 2 other programmers and 2 artists over the course of 6 months.

Key points:
* Unreal Engine 4.26
* First Person View
* Parkour ground movement
* Rope swinging air movement
* Checkpoint/save system
* Options Menu
* Cyberpunk-like aesthetics
